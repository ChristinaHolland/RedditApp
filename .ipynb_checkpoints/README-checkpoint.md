# Natural Language Processing and Funko POP figures
### Christina Holland

## Executive Summary

Funko POP figures have populated the homes and office spaces of pop culture and genre fans all around the world. But the world of genre fandom, Funko's market base, is an ever shifting landscape with books and shows exploding into the forefront, and others falling from favor (looking at you, Game of Thrones). How best to keep up with that, and keep a finger on the pulse of the fandom, in order to always offer the specific figures they most desire? 

__The answer is Data science.__

Through the wonder of classification models built with natural language processing, this study will analize thousands of comments on fan subreddits to determine the latest hot topics in fantasy and science fiction. By using a classification model to separate and correctly identify comments from the subreddits r/fantasy and r/scifi (each 12 years old, and over a million menbers each), we can identify trending topics: words or phrases that are specifically and quintessentially "fantasy" or "science fiction".
